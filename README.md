# Ivy


Ivy is a proof of concept MERN stack application worked out over two weeks with a small group of part
time
developers. This application provides a way to plan roadtrips without having a destination in mind,
allowing the user to focus on the trip and not the destination. On this application, I lead the mapping
portion of
the project. This invloved collating data from various APIs in order to filter out locations and give
the
user a small selection of interesting nearby cities within a day's drive to slowly develop a longer
interesting roadtrip.


## Ideas Learned


This project made me learn the importance of being able to read through data provided from other
services and being able to use it in my own application. Data is paramount in any application's
functions, and being able to use this data to display the user useful information is at the heart of any
application.
